## The Sudoku Game
    For now, its just a simple sudoku game with minimal graphics, however I do plan to make it multiplayer/collaborative. 

# Compile for Linux
    ```
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install \
        libxrandr-dev \
        libxcursor-dev \
        libudev-dev \
        libfreetype-dev \
        libflac-dev \
        libvorbis-dev \
        libgl1-mesa-dev \
        libegl1-mesa-dev \
        libfreetype-dev
    ```
    ```
    cmake -B build
    cmake --build build
   ```
